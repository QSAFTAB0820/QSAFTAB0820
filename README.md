## 📂 Projects

> Below are some example projects that represent the kind of work I do. Repositories will include clear README files, notebooks, and explanations.

- **Customer Churn Analysis**  
  - Performed EDA on customer data to understand patterns behind churn vs. non-churn.  
  - Engineered features, handled missing values, and built classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict churn.  
  - Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and used feature importance to highlight key business drivers.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects**  
  - Analyzed different datasets (sales, customer behavior, or public datasets) using Pandas and visualization tools.  
  - Cleaned and transformed raw data, created visual insights using Power BI/Tableau/Matplotlib, and summarized key trends and patterns.  
  - Focused on answering business-style questions and deriving actionable insights.

- **Machine Learning Model Building Notebooks**  
  - Built end-to-end ML workflows in Jupyter Notebooks using scikit-learn.  
  - Covered data preprocessing, train-test splits, model training, hyperparameter tuning (basic), and result interpretation.  
  - Documented each step to make notebooks easy to follow for recruiters and collaborators.
